	Engineering is a broad term that covers a wide range of applications and industries. \
	Combining mathematics, science and technology, engineers produce creative solutions to \
	real world problems. As a result there are many different types of engineering degrees \
	available.In the past, engineering could be divided into four major branches: Mechanical, \
	Chemical, Civil and Electrical, with sub branches of each discipline. Today however, the \
	number of engineering degrees available have increased dramatically. There are now six \
	major branches of engineering: Mechanical, Chemical, Civil, Electrical, Management, and \
	Geotechnical, and literally hundreds of different subcategories of engineering under each \
	branch.Take a look over the list below - all types of engineering degrees are provided in \
	summary with a link to a full article with more detail on each where available. You can also \
	find links to universities offering that specific degree, or use the below search to find \
	available engineering degrees. You can use the main navigation to find specifics on the different\
	types of engineering degrees, including the emerging online engineering degree. For general \
	engineering articles including information on the highest paying degrees, those with the best \
	employment potential, and steps to become an engineer, be sure to check the blog",
